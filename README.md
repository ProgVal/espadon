# espadon.rs

A EcmaScript (JavaScript) parser writter in Rust. Currently it supports very basic statements.

## Origin of the name

Espadon in French means [Swordfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordfish), one of the [fastest marine animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordfish#Behavior_and_ecology).

Also this name has been chosen for its two first letters as a tribute to EcmaScript, whose name is commonly abbreviated "ES".
